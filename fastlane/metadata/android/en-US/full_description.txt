This is a Xposed Module that enables 
Statho for every application on your phone. All Stetho functions
are given besides Network Monitoring. For this however I highly recommend using mitmproxy
or tcpdump and Wireshark.

This Module can be used for Reverse Engineering. Especially the Layout Preview is very useful. Please also
take a look at Inspackage since this will add even more functions
for this purpose.
