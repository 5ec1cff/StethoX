StethoX
=======

Original Project: https://gitlab.com/derSchabi/Stethox

This is a [Xposed](http://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer) Module that enables 
[Statho](https://facebook.github.io/stetho/) for every application on your phone. All Stetho functions
are given besides Network Monitoring. For this however I highly recommend using [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/)
or [tcpdump](http://www.tcpdump.org/) and [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

This Module can be used for Reverse Engineering. Especially the Layout Preview is very useful. Please also
take a look at [Inspackage](https://ac-pm.github.io/Inspeckage/) since this will add even more functions
for this purpose.

## ATENTION
Never leave this Module enabled or installed on day to day use.
__THIS IS A SECURETY RISK__. Only enable this for Development.
